  I talked with you about setting up a website for blogging, so I went and did one better and whipped up a website for you. 
  
  Well, that's only half true. 
   
  In reality, I cobbled this together to show show you what you'll need to get going. I can do most of the legwork for setting up your website, but there's a few things I'll need from you.
  
  1. Start up a Github - I need you to register a [Github](www.github.com) account in your name with your student email so we can start the process of setting this kind of website up. Make the password something you don't mind sharing with me, since I'll need to get on it to start everything up.
  2. If you don't want a webpage that looks like (yourusername).github.io we'll need to set you up with a domain name. Good thing you're a student! [Namecheap](nc.me) gives out free domain names to students for one year, and afterwards charges about 10-15 dollars a year. it's a good investment and worth the 2 or 3 starbucks coffees it would cost. If you register a domain name, I can set it up as the destination for all your blogging content.
  3. You're going to have to learn about the [Markdown Language](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started). Markdown is pretty much word processing but with some special characters that are required if you want to format your text or add pictures. Then again if you really wanted to you could use some .docx to .md converter out there to convert your blog posts, but I really don't know how those work.
  4. That's pretty much it. if we want to style up your blog a bit more, I'll need some time to talk with you and learn what you want. Good thing my work is sending back the weekend of the 10-6! And here I thought I wouldn't see you for a while.
